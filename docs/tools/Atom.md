Atom
===

Atom is a hackable, open source text editor built by GitHub.

It's built on the electron framework and provides a easy to customize
interface, so it can become the right text editor for all situations.

Starting by editing config files, through writing markdown or LaTeX documents
up to [full featured IDEs][atom-ide].

By default it comes with a small set of plugins which allow to work smoothly
with GitHub as well as edit Atom itself. Git integration is of course also
built-in and for those who need more, there is an entire repository full of
plugins, so called packages, ready to be installed and used.

If you are interested in working with your colleagues, try
[teletype][atom-teletype] and use WebRTC to collaborate.

Tips and Tricks
---

For those who often tour around on the CLI and don't want to use a file browser
to get into the right project directory, the easiest way to open atom in the
current directory is running `atom .`. Notice, this is non-blocking, so no
worries about your shell.

For the people who prefer the mouse but also want to start Atom in place, this
repository provides a nautilus extension that add a context menu entry: "Open
Atom here"
