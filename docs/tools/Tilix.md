Tilix
===

Tilix, the terminal emulator that comes with this repository is a feature-rich,
tiling window terminal emulator.

The tiling layout makes it easy to run different shell commands in parallel as
well as just checking the output of one and typing in another or keep track of
a long running task while working on something else.

Apart from this even for people who are not handy with mass SSH or Ansible
it's easily possible to run shell commands on multiple machines or directories
as Tilix allows to synchronize the input of all or selected terminals.

From a security perspective it's also helpful because it'll warn you when you
may paste something containing a `sudo` command and asks for confirmation
for this paste.
