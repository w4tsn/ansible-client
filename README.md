Ansible Client Deployment
===

This repository provides the ability to install your Client in a few minutes.

We setup various things, like updating your client to the latest state, install packages like VSCode, VLC, Tilix and more, to take your whole client into a working state.

Usage
---

Clone the repository, and use `ansible-playbook` to run it.


### Fedora

```
sudo dnf install git ansible
git clone https://octo.sh/ansible-client/ansible-client.git
cd ansible-client
ansible-playbook clients.yml
```

### Extend/personalize your setup

To extend the default packages you can use `extend_packages` in your `host_vars/localhost` file.

To install [`cowsay`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay) for example:

```yaml

extend_packages:
  - dnf: cowsay

```
